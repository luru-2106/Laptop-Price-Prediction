# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This project shows a Laptop price prediction system by using the supervised machine learning technique. The research uses random decision forest as the machine learning prediction method which offered 88.7% prediction precision. Using random decision forest, there are multiple independent variables but one and only one dependent variable whose actual and predicted values are compared to find precision of results. 
This project proposes a system where price is dependent variable which is predicted, and this price is derived from factors like Laptop’s model, RAM, ROM (HDD/SSD), GPU, CPU, IPS Display, and Touch Screen. 

Core Language and Environment 
•	Python
•	Google Collab Notebook

Key Python Libraries 
These libraries are the workhorses of any data science project: 
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn 
•	Scikit-learn (sklearn)

o	Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.). 

o	Evaluation: Measuring the performance and accuracy of the model. 

Machine Learning Algorithms & Concepts 
While the provided code focuses on data preparation, the final model would use specific algorithms. The core concepts and algorithms involved are: 
•	Regression Algorithms: Since the goal is to predict a continuous value 
(price), regression models are used. Common choices for this task include: 
o Linear Regression o Random Forest Regressor 

•	Feature Engineering: The process of creating new, meaningful features from the existing data to improve the model's accuracy.
