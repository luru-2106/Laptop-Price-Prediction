# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This project shows a Laptop price prediction system by using the supervised machine learning technique. The research uses random decision forest as the machine learning prediction method which offered 88.7% prediction precision. Using random decision forest, there are multiple independent variables but one and only one dependent variable whose actual and predicted values are compared to find precision of results. 
This project proposes a system where price is dependent variable which is predicted, and this price is derived from factors like Laptop’s model, RAM, ROM (HDD/SSD), GPU, CPU, IPS Display, and Touch Screen. 

Core Language and Environment 
•	Python: This is the primary programming language used. Its simple syntax and extensive collection of libraries make it the top choice for machine learning and data science projects.  
•	Google Collab Notebook: This is the interactive development environment where the code is written, executed, and visualized. It's perfect for data analysis because it allows you to run code in small chunks (cells) and see the output immediately. 
Key Python Libraries 
These libraries are the workhorses of any data science project: 
•	Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis. It's used to load the dataset (from a CSV file), clean it, and structure it in a DataFrame (a tablelike format). 
•	NumPy: The fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It's used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations, which is crucial for feature engineering (like calculating PPI). 
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: These are the primary libraries for data visualization. They are used to create the plots and charts (like bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps) you see in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to understand the data's patterns and relationships.  
•	Scikit-learn (sklearn): This is the most important library for machine learning. It provides the tools for: o Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets (train_test_split). 
o	Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.). 
o	Evaluation: Measuring the performance and accuracy of the model. 
Machine Learning Algorithms & Concepts 
While the provided code focuses on data preparation, the final model would use specific algorithms. The core concepts and algorithms involved are: 
•	Regression Algorithms: Since the goal is to predict a continuous value 
(price), regression models are used. Common choices for this task include: 
o Linear Regression o Random Forest Regressor 
•	Feature Engineering: The process of creating new, meaningful features from the existing data to improve the model's accuracy.
